            <h3>Objectives</h3> 
            Create a fraud level detection tool based on simulated credit card transaction data.
            <p></p>

            <h3>Usefulness</h3>
            This application identifies potential fraud or fraud-related credit card charges. 
            There are similar applications/models available, however, those models are typically 
            internal or proprietary to a particular bank or credit card company. 
            This application will target consumers and business owners as main stakeholders. 
            Users will be able to audit their credit card transactions for fraudulent activity, 
            review features that lead to potentially fraudulent transactions, 
            and explore other unique insights based on their transaction and spending history.
            <p></p>
		
            <h3>Dataset</h3>
            Credit Card Fraud: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection</a><br>

            The dataset is simulated credit card transactions between Jan. 1st, 2019 and Dec. 31st,
            2020. The credit card simulated data was generated using the Sparkov Data Generation 
            tool by Brandon Harris and the owner of the dataset is Kartik Shenoy. It was generated 
            in 2020 and the purpose was to have more realistic simulated transactions. 
            The training data is 1,296,675 records and the test data is 555,719 - with both csv 
            files having the same 23 features. The dataset does not contain any NA values and does 
            not require intensive cleaning. But our team still intends to perform the necessary 
            actions to verify and will still need to clean the dataset.
            <p></p>

            <h3>Functionality</h3>
            The data science functions of interest involve performing statistical analysis on the 
            dataset and doing classification modeling. We intend to have a classification model 
            to determine fraudulent transactions and determine various levels based on thresholds 
            of spend. Our application will have the capability to perform fraud level detection 
            based on feature input from a user interface. For example, a user can input features 
            such as purchase category, amount spent, or merchant name. Other features can be used 
            to visualize the statistics of the dataset. For example, we can use features like date 
            of transaction to analyze if fraud occurs more often or less during certain times of 
            the year. Similarly, we can use features like merchant latitude and merchant longitude 
            to analyze if fraud occurs in certain merchant locations.
